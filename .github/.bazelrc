# Print all enabled Bazel flags in CI mode. This makes it easier to debug and reproduce
# Bazel issues that show up on GitHub Actions.

# Save downloaded repositories in a location that can be cached by GitHub Actions. This helps us
# speeding up the analysis time significantly with Bazel managed node dependencies on the CI.

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645. Bazel doesn't calculate the
# memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker. Limit Bazel to consuming resources that
# fit in GitHub Actions. https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources
# Note that we use less than the available RAM as bazel only estimates memory for actions
# and we don't want to accidentally run out of memory.
